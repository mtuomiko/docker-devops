Start image command:
docker run -it --name curlbuntu ubuntu:latest sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

Not working, input helsinki.fi gives error 'sh: 1: curl: not found' 

Start container again:
docker start curlbuntu

Running container is not attached.

Start bash inside the container:
docker exec -it curlbuntu bash

Install curl and exit:
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
exit

Attach the running container:
docker attach curlbuntu

The process is still waiting for input (we didn't see the first output line because we weren't attached).
Input:
helsinki.fi

... and we get the expected HTML response.

Running the container again, this time attached:
docker start -ai curlbuntu
