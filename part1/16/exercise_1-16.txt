Heroku app found at url:
https://pure-refuge-98503.herokuapp.com/

I realize that the application doesn't function as intended. 
It is unable to access some of it's assets (css and js) and removing presses 
does not work. I believe this is a problem with the image and is not related 
to the deployment to Heroku.
